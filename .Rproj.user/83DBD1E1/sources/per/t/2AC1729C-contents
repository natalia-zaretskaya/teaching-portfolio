Lecture - excersize

If a lecture format is required, I structure the lecture in a way that stimulates the thought process rather than simply conveys the facts. I include a strong interaction component and deliver a lecture in dialog with the audience by using digital response polls. In seminars and courses, which allow for more flexibility, I apply active learning techniques such as 1) the think-pair-share technique for working on problems in small groups, 2) response polls (with the use of digital tools where applicable) to initiate discussions or to assess learning efficiency, 3) brainstorming – asking students to share their knowledge about the topic, which I then summarize and complete, or stimulating search for solutions to a specific problem before presenting existing solutions, 4) debate – contrasting opposing point of views in a discussion to illustrate the complexity of a topic.
