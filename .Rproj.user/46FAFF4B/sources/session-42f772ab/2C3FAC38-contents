## Non-university teaching

Though modest, I do have some experience teaching outside of academia.

-   Summer 2024: Introduction to EEG to high school students as part of the biology class at Graz International Bilingual School (together with Ana Arsenovic, see the picture below).

-   2009-2013 Hands-on demonstrations of the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the "Girls day" (activity to engage young women in STEM) at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/en), Tübingen, Germany

-   2009-2012 Hands-on demonstrations of the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at the Open House of the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/en), Tübinge, Germany
