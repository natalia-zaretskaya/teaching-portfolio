    "text": "1.1 “We work for tomorrow”\nThere are many important principles that I apply or try to apply in teaching. This section briefly summarized those ones that are particularly important for me.\nThe current slogan of the University of Graz perfectly matches my teaching goal of educating young professionals that are well equipped for the challenges of the modern world, such as big data and digitalization. To achieve this goal, I try to integrate newest trends and developments in research theory and practice into the curriculum. Students in my courses are up to date on the newest software and digital research tools, open science practices, statistics approaches, and, most importantly, on the most recent research findings. I also try to show them the relevance of the topics we cover for our everyday life and society. For example, when talking about the neural mechanisms of consciousness, we also discuss the potential consciousness of Artificial Intelligence and ethical issues associated with it. When talking about basic perceptual mechanisms I indicate how these principles are employed in advertisement. [conclusion needed]",

    "text": "1.2 Research first\nFor me this term means much more than just integration of research into teaching activities. In my courses students practice different aspects of being researchers, with me acting as their senior colleague rather than a lecturer. I support students in pursuing their interests, while they can draw upon my knowledge and experience in solving specific research problems. In addition to receiving formal knowledge, I introduce the internal logic of research, accepted practices and unwritten rules. Although I would love to see every one of my student becoming a top-class researcher, it is clear to me that only a tiny fraction of them will become researchers at all. Nevertheless, I do not want to lower the bar, since I believe that knowing how research is done is important for every responsible citizen.",

Already as a graduate student I completed a course on university teaching and didactics, and continued to visit structured courses ever since (a list of attended didactic courses is available in the Appendix).\n\n\n1.3.2 Informal exchange\nApart from formal education, I get inspiration, insights and valuable ideas by exchanging experience with colleagues over lunch or coffee. A useful experience is teaching a course together with another colleague. Most importantly, I regularly ask students who have participated in my courses in the past and then joined my lab in another capacity for input about what was useful and what could have been done better. Also students whom I never taught myself, but who joined my lab as interns, bachelor or master students can oftentimes provide valuable insights into the needs the students have in terms of course structure and content.\n\n\n1.3.3 Formal feedback\nEvery full course I held has undergone a final evaluation using the standard UGOnline questionnaire. At the University of Graz I subjected every course to the evaluation procedure voluntarily (course evaluations are available in the Appendix). Even though during the last class I always reserve time for anonymous UGOnline feedback, some students manage not to submit their comment nevertheless. This semester I implemented a new rule in my courses, requiring students to submit evaluation through UGOnline as a part of their coursework in order to be graded. I am curious to see how it turns out.",

I use Mentimeter, and more recently also Particify, to conduct polls, quizzes, and sometimes even small experiments during the lecture. During the lecture I also use Particify’s Q&A function in addition to in-person questions. So far students’ feedback has been extremely positive. Digital tools allow shy students to ask their questions anonymously, which encourages participation of engagement of a larger proportion of the students. As a lecturer I found Particify’s Q&A function useful, because it allows to answer questions offline later, saving time during the lecture and allowing me as a lecturer to be better prepared for the answer.",

After the class, I post the solutions to moodle. An additional motivation for the students is the fact that similar problems will be at the final exam. An example worksheet can be found in the Appendix. Such approach encourages students to independently think about the problems and search for solutions, which increases the learning efficiency.",

This works particularly well in classes with more proficient and self-motivated students, who actively listen to my explanations.

    "text": "2.5 Learning by doing\nAs someone who studies subjective experience, I think this experience is very important. This is why in lectures, seminars, courses and other formats that do not necessarily imply any hands-on experience, I nevertheless add a great deal of it. For the Perception and Attention lecture I built the Ame’s room and had students look at it and into it after the lectures to better understand how the perception of depth and size are connected.\n\n\n\nThese two figures are the same size, but they appear different because they are located at different distances from the observer. The walls and floor are painted in a way that makes us think the back wall is straight ahead of us. (c) Visual Neuroscience Lab\n\n\nFor the seminar on visual illusions I invited students into the perception lab to view the illusion demonstration on a high-quality monitor with special 3D glasses. If certain illusions are particularly hard to demonstrate or for some reason we do not have the working demonstration, I point them to locations in Graz (like CoSA or Wahrnhemungsmuseum), where they can experience a specific effect.\n\n\n\nDemonstration at of binocular rivalry illusion at Perception Lab. (c) Visual Neuroscience Lab\n\n\nWhenever I create a demonstration for a lecture, I provide a like to code that I used to generate it. Of course not all students are inclined to programming, but playing around with code can be quite useful for understanding how things work. This is why a whole github repository has already developed around my “Perception and Attention” Lecture, although it was not really planned (https://github.com/natalia-zaretskaya/allgemeine1). It will definitely be improved and extended.\nThe things described above are just a few of very many examples.",

In some courses where I feel the students will profit from direct coaching but will be to shy to ask for an appointment, I introduced “obligatory” office hours as part of course work. Formally, students need to first create a list of questions on their own, then discuss their questions with the small group of peers, and then come to me with those questions they could not figure out among themselves. These steps constitute an ungraded assignement they need to submit, and most of the times helps them understand the material better.",

The idea to switch to quarto came to me when working on the lecture content for the General Psychology I lecture course, which was the first full lecture course I taught. I realized that I need a tool that allows to generate slides and a reading-friendly PDF from the same content, and it would also be great if I could directly run some code for students to see how changing some parameters changes the output. My dream has always been to be able to cite scientific articles and make the citations clickable, so that any interested student is immediately redirected to the original paper. Quarto has all these capabilities. Gradually I am transferring all my teaching materials from .pptx to quarto, and although initially it was a struggle, I am quite fluent now. In the Appendix interesting reader can find example content generated with quarto.",

It will take course participants through all stages of a functional MRI study:\n\nplanning and programming an experiment,\nacquiring the data\ndata preprocessing\ndata analysis and interpretation.\n\nCourse participants can choose between working on an experiment which is part of their doctoral thesis, or inventing a completely new experiment.\nIn addition to theoretical input, the course will have a strong practical component. Students will first present their projects/ideas in class. After this, the class will select the best project, which will be implemented into a computer program. Together with the lecturer we will conduct an fMRI experiment with one volunteer. The course participants will get access to a server, and each person will go through all stages of data preprocessing and analysis. Open science practices in the field of neuroimaging will also be introduced.\n\n\nPrevious Knowledge Expected\nBasic knowledge of neuroimaging methods in cognitive neuroscience\n\n\nObjective (Expected Results of Study and Acquired Competences)\nAfter completing the course participants should be able to:\n\nunderstand the possibilities and limitations of functional MRI experiments\nbe able to plan and conduction fMRI experiments in practice\nknow and apply open science practices in the field of neuroimaging.\n\n\n\nLanguages of Instruction\nEnglish\n\n\nTeaching and Learning Method (Transfer of Skills)\nUnder the supervision of the course instructor students will acquire knowledge by a) reading, understanding and critically reviewing newest scientific research literature related to the topic b) conducting a small fMRI project and interpreting its results.\n\n\nWorkload for students\nIn-class oral presentations, experiment preparation (divided across class members), individually conducted data analysis, individual final essay.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2 Journal club\nAlthough doctoral students in psychology doctoral school are used to critically reading articles from their undergraduate studies (I heard from the colleague at the MedUni that it is the other way around for them), I think it is important to keep up the critical thinking skill, while at the same time being aware of the most recent literature. This course is not planned yet, this is my idea for the not-so-near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent\nThis seminar is intended to train doctoral students in critical thinking and scientific presentation skills, while learning about newest developements in the research field directly relevant for their theses work.\nEach course participant will chose a paper directly relevant for the topic of their PhD thesis and present it in class with a critical discussion of the paper’s content. Course participants will be required to read the paper and ask at least one question to the speaker, submitting the questions beforehand. In each session in addition to the presenter/speaker, one other person will introduce the speaker and moderate discussion.\n\n\nPrevious Knowledge Expected\nn/a\n\n\nObjective (Expected Results of Study and Acquired Competences)\nAfter completing the course participants should be able to:\n\ncritically assess scientific articles in their or related field\npresent the content of a scientific article in a clear and understandable manner\nbe able to lead a scientific discussion\n\n\n\nLanguages of Instruction\nEnglish\n\n\nTeaching and Learning Method (Transfer of Skills)\nUnder the supervision of the course instructor students will acquire knowledge by reading, understanding and critically reviewing newest scientific research literature related to the topic.\n\n\nWorkload for students\nWorkload for students: In-class oral presentations, weekly readings and questions, individual final essay.",
