{"title":"Philosophy","markdown":{"headingText":"Philosophy","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThere are many important principles that I apply or try to apply in teaching. This section briefly summarized those ones that are particularly important for me.\n\n## *“We work for* tomorrow*”*\n\nThe current slogan of the University of Graz perfectly matches my teaching goal of educating young professionals that are well equipped for the challenges of the modern world, such as big data and digitalization. To achieve this goal, I try to integrate newest trends and developments in research theory and practice into the curriculum. Students in my courses are up to date on the newest software and digital research tools, open science practices, statistics approaches, and, most importantly, on the most recent research findings. I also try to show them the relevance of the topics we cover for our everyday life and society. For example, when talking about the neural mechanisms of consciousness, we also discuss the potential consciousness of Artificial Intelligence and ethical issues associated with it. When talking about basic perceptual mechanisms I indicate how these principles are employed in advertisement. \\[conclusion needed\\]\n\n## Research first\n\nFor me this term means much more than just integration of research into teaching activities. In my courses students practice different aspects of *being* researchers, with me acting as their senior colleague rather than a lecturer. I support students in pursuing their interests, while they can draw upon my knowledge and experience in solving specific research problems. In addition to receiving formal knowledge, I introduce the internal logic of research, accepted practices and unwritten rules. Although I would love to see every one of my student becoming a top-class researcher, it is clear to me that only a tiny fraction of them will become researchers at all. Nevertheless, I do not want to lower the bar, since I believe that knowing how research is done is important for every responsible citizen.\n\n## Continuous self-improvement\n\n### Didactics courses\n\nThroughout my career I have always striven for improving my teaching skills. Already as a graduate student I completed a course on university teaching and didactics, and continued to visit structured courses ever since (a list of attended didactic courses is available in the [Appendix](appendix.qmd#sec-certificates)).\n\n### Informal exchange\n\nApart from formal education, I get inspiration, insights and valuable ideas by exchanging experience with colleagues over lunch or coffee. A useful experience is teaching a course together with another colleague. Most importantly, I regularly ask students who have participated in my courses in the past and then joined my lab in another capacity for input about what was useful and what could have been done better. Also students whom I never taught myself, but who joined my lab as interns, bachelor or master students can oftentimes provide valuable insights into the needs the students have in terms of course structure and content.\n\n### Formal feedback\n\nEvery full course I held has undergone a final evaluation using the standard UGOnline questionnaire. At the University of Graz I subjected every course to the evaluation procedure voluntarily (course evaluations are available in the [Appendix](appendix.qmd#sec-evaluations)). Even though during the last class I always reserve time for anonymous UGOnline feedback, some students manage not to submit their comment nevertheless. This semester I implemented a new rule in my courses, requiring students to submit evaluation through UGOnline as a part of their coursework in order to be graded. I am curious to see how it turns out.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"philosophy.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
